# Adhicine - Tracking Of Medicine Routines

Adhicine is a Flutter-based application designed to help users track and manage their medicine intake efficiently. The app utilizes Firebase for authentication, database management, and notifications to enhance the user experience.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Implemented using Firebase Authentication (Google Sign-In).
- **Medicine Tracking**: Users can log their medicines and get reminders.
- **Firestore Database**: All user data is securely stored in Firebase Firestore.
- **Push Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is used to send reminders.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Ensures clean code, better maintainability, and scalability.

## Project Structure

The app follows a feature-wise segregation inside the `lib/` directory, ensuring modularity and scalability. Each feature follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture.

```

|   |-- auth/  (Authentication related files)
